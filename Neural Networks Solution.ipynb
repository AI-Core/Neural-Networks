    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "- [Classification](https://github.com/AI-Core/Strong-ML-Foundations/blob/master/Classification.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why do simple models struggle with meaningful tasks?\n",
    "\n",
    "Whereas the size of a house and its price might be linearly correlated, the pixel intensities of an image are certainly not linearly correlated with whether it contains a dog or a cat.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./images/complex-fn.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to build much more complex models to solve harder problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Can we build more complex models by combining many simple transformations?\n",
    "\n",
    "The models we have just seen apply a single transformation to the data. However most problems of practical interest can't be solved using such simple models. \n",
    "\n",
    "Models with greater **capacity** are those which are able to model more complicated functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "A single linear transformation (multiplication by weights of model) stretches the input space by a certain factor in some direction, and adding a constant (bias) shifts it. \n",
    "We call models which apply  \n",
    "What if we applied more than one **layer** of transformations to our inputs, to create a **deep model**. Would we be able to increase the capacity of our model and make it able to model more complex input-output relationships, particularly non-linear ones?\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./images/shallow-vs-deep.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "...well, not quite yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "...if we repeatedly apply a linear transformation, the input can be factorised out of the output, showing that many repeated linear functions are eventually equal to a single linear transformation.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./images/factor-proof.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## So how can we increase the capacity of our models?\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to be able to model non-linear functions, so let's try to throw in some non-linear transformations into our model.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./images/activation.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "These non-linear functions prevent the input being able to be factorised out of the model. Hence the overall transformation can represent non-linear input-output relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "We call these non-linear functions **activation functions**.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, It's not like we want to introduce really complicated functions into our model - ideally we wouldn't even have to and we could keep things simple. So let's try and complicate things only a minimal amount by keeping our activation functions very simple.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some common activation functions. ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) is by far the most widely used.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./images/activ-fns.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we have all of the ingredients to fully understand how we can model more complicated functions. Let's look at that all together:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./images/full-nn.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Guess what? That is a **neural network**. Surprise.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's just repeated simple linear transformations followed by simple non-linear transformations (activation functions). Simple.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's learn some jargon.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./images/nn.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Neural networks have additional hyperparameters of the depth of the model and the width of each layer. These \n",
    "\n",
    "## What can neural networks do?\n",
    "\n",
    "The motivation that led us to deriving neural networks was that we wanted to model more complex functions. But what functions can a neural network actually represent? Well, as we show below they can actually represent almost all continuous functions. Neural Networks are **general function approximators**.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./images/univ-approx.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## How can our neural networks learn to model some function?\n",
    "\n",
    "As we did in the optimisation notebook, we can adjust our model parameters using gradient descent as such:\n",
    "1. Pass input data forward through model to output a prediction\n",
    "2. Calculate loss between predicted output and output label\n",
    "3. Find direction that moving the model parameters in will reduce the error\n",
    "4. Move model weights (parameters) a small amount in that direction \n",
    "\n",
    "![](./images/backprop.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here you can see that many terms reappear when computing the gradients of preceeding layers. \n",
    "By caching those terms, we save having to recompute them for these layers nearer the input. This makes finding the gradients of the loss with respect to each weight in the model much more efficient both in terms of memory and speed. \n",
    "This process of computing these gradients effectively is called the **backpropagation**."

    "\n",
    "1. `torch.nn.Module` keeps track of all `torch.nn.Parameters` that are created within it. So when we add a linear layer to our model, the parameters (matrix of weights) in that layer will be added to a list of our model's parameters. We can retrieve all parameters of our model using its `parameters()` method. We will later pass this (`mymodel.parameters()`) to our optimiser when we tell it that *this* is what it should be optimising.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `torch.nn.Module` treats the `forward` method (function) of any child class specially by assigning it to the `__call__` method. That means that running `mymodel.forward(some_data)` is equal to `mymodel(some_data)`. \n",

The output should represent a categorical probability distribution over which class the input belongs to. What shape does it need to be? What function does it need to have applied to it?"
