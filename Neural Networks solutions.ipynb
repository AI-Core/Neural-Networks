    "Whereas the size of a house and its price might be linearly correlated, the pixel intensities of an image are certainly not linearly correlated with whether it contains a dog or a cat.\n",

    "We need to build much more complex models to solve harder problems.\n",

    "## Can we build more complex models by combining many simple transformations?\n",
    "\n",
    "The models we have just seen apply a single transformation to the data. However most problems of practical interest can't be solved using such simple models. \n",
    "\n",
    "Models with greater **capacity** are those which are able to model more complicated functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "A single linear transformation (multiplication by weights of model) stretches the input space by a certain factor in some direction, and adding a constant (bias) shifts it. \n",
    "We call models which apply  \n",
    "What if we applied more than one **layer** of transformations to our inputs, to create a **deep model**. Would we be able to increase the capacity of our model and make it able to model more complex input-output relationships, particularly non-linear ones?\n",

    "\n",
    "## So how can we increase the capacity of our models?\n",

    "\n",
    "![](./images/activation.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "These non-linear functions prevent the input being able to be factorised out of the model. Hence the overall transformation can represent non-linear input-output relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "We call these non-linear functions **activation functions**.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, It's not like we want to introduce really complicated functions into our model - ideally we wouldn't even have to and we could keep things simple. So let's try and complicate things only a minimal amount by keeping our activation functions very simple.\n",

    "PyTorch makes it really easy for us to build complex models that can be improved via gradient based optimisation. It does this by providing a class named `torch.nn.Module`. Our model classes should inherit from this class because it does a few very useful things for us:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `torch.nn.Module` keeps track of all `torch.nn.Parameters` that are created within it. So when we add a linear layer to our model, the parameters (matrix of weights) in that layer will be added to a list of our model's parameters. We can retrieve all parameters of our model using its `parameters()` method. We will later pass this (`mymodel.parameters()`) to our optimiser when we tell it that *this* is what it should be optimising.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `torch.nn.Module` treats the `forward` method (function) of any child class specially by assigning it to the `__call__` method. That means that running `mymodel.forward(some_data)` is equal to `mymodel(some_data)`. \n",
    "\n",

    "Hint: what layer have I linked to?\n",

    "After we've defined some layers for our model we should implement the forward function that will define what happens when we call an instance of our class. This should pass the argument (our input data) through each of the layers, and apply an activation function to them between each, before returning the transformed input as the output. The output should represent a categorical probability distribution over which class the input belongs to. What shape does it need to be? What function does it need to have applied to it?"
